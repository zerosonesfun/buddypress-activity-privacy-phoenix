# BuddyPress Activity Privacy (Phoenix)

An attempt to make the original BuddyPress Activity Privacy plugin rise from the ashes like a Phoenix.

BuddyPress Activity Privacy plugin adds a privacy level to the activity stream component. The plugin adds the ability for members to choose who can read their activity (Anyone, Logged In Users, My Friends, Admins Only, Only me, My Friends in Group, Group Members, etc.).

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

WordPress & BuddyPress

### Installing

- Download and upload the plugin zip file at yoursite/wp-admin/plugin-install.php.

- Then Activate the plugin.

- You can choose the visibility level from the select box in the Activity Post Form.


## Contributing

Contributors and even a permanent lead maintainer (developer) are sorely needed. I will try to find time to make updates, however, I have higher priorities.
